# Petrol-consumption-prediction
For one year, the consumption of petrol was measured in 48 states. The relevant variables are the petrol tax, the average income per capita, the number of miles of paved highway, and the proportion of the population with driver's licenses. Fit simple linear regression models to predict the consumption of petrol by using each of the predictors A1 â€“ A4.

There are 48 rows of data in REG1.xlsx that include:

* A1, Petrol tax (cents per gallon)
* A2, Average income (dollars)
* A3, Paved Highways (miles)
* A4, Proportion of population with driver's licenses
* B, Consumption of petrol (millions of gallons)
